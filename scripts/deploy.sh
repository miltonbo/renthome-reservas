# deptosbo — full droplet-side build + deploy (FALLBACK).
#
# Builds AND deploys on the droplet. Slow (~18 min on the 458 MB box) and
# only kept around as a fallback when the CI build pipeline is unavailable
# (eg GH Actions outage, working from a branch that hasn't been pushed).
#
# Normal deploys are now handled by .github/workflows/deploy.yml +
# scripts/install-build.sh: the runner does the heavy build and ships
# the artifact, the install script swaps it in (~30s on the droplet).
#
# To use this fallback manually:
#   ssh app@<droplet>
#   cd /home/app/deptosbo
#   bash scripts/deploy.sh
#
# Aborts cleanly on any failed step BEFORE touching the running service,
# so a broken build never kills production. The systemctl restart is
# the very last step.
#
# Pre-reqs (set up once, see docs/DROPLET-SETUP.md):
#   - /home/app/deptosbo is the git checkout
#   - .env.production is in place with DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, CRON_SECRET, GEMINI key
#   - Node 22 LTS on PATH
#   - sudo NOPASSWD entry for `app` covering `systemctl restart deptosbo`
